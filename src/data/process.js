Take a look at all the requirements, and list out the questions about things that is still in doubt, even things that you are sure about then give it to the users. You can use many available tools to do survey, collect ideas from users. There is not always good ideas, but there will be some really good ideas come from the users.',

The reason to let the team in; team here includes: visual designer, UI designer, probably any designers, product managers, the VPs, developers, QA also can join at this stage; is to give a chance to everyone to understand the products at the very beginning, everyone owns the product, not only PMs. You may think it does not need to do this at this stage because it will take a lot of time, but it’s just not that much of time later on when you are in design phase and some PM suddenly ask a random question about why we go with that color? To prevent confusion and make sure everyone is clear about what we build and what is our goal, you always need to include people from the early step.',

Many designers like to do high fidelity wireframes, but in my process, let’s stick the lo-fi first. Reason is you don’t want to spend much time on drawing, but to spend more time on exploring the designs. Wireframes help you to do that. Don’t think too much about the pixels, how big or small the text, you just want to explore different design approaches and see what is the best solution. You can try design sprint at this step, it is a very good method for quick but high quality result. The main point of wireframes is to let everyone gives their idea, exploring options and once everyone agrees on one, we can start further design without any changes or confusion.',

        'Once done with the wireframes, prototypes, the UI guys start doing the rest of the jobs. However, this UI part is quite complicated to get it right. Reason is some startups are not trying to do much works at their first or beta release. But later on, UX and UI need to stay very closed with each other. UI is about beauty, UX sometimes has different approach, so the two needs to agree on each other. Be strict on colors, spacing, padding, font size. What we often did is to create a UI style guide, a good way to keep consistency of designs. The UX part is not finished here yet, we still need to think about the usability of each UI elements (form label placements, buttons size…). The UI style guide is a main part of design work later on. Hence it needs human effort to maintain, improve time after time. So make sure your UI and UX works well together, easy to maintain and always be consistent.',

We need to use analytic tools to track how users use our product, how they interact, can they get the goal that we want them to? If not, what is wrong? For big UX team, they always have a UX Researcher who will do this work. Their task is to test new designs, analysis all the data from users using our products, then give the solutions, recommendation to improve the function, design.',
